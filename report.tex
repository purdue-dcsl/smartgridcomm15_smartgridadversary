\section{Introduction}

It is trite but true that the power grid underlies most of modern civilization.  Traditionally the power grid has had a 
few fixed producers that sell power to utilities, who in turn distribute it to their customers.  Traditionally these 
customers have not coordinated with the utility, but simply bought whatever power they need at the prevailing price.  
Similarily, utilities have simply ensured that they have enough power to meet their customer's demands.  

The future will be very different.  More producers will enter the grid as renewables like wind and solar become more
prevalent.  Increased connectivity through the Smart Grid will allow consumers to be price sensitive, and put off 
demand during peak usage (and thus peak price) hours where possible.  This will smooth the demand curve that utilities face,
and make the grid more predictable.

In the smart grid, consumers will communicate their power demands and constraints to the utility, who will then schedule
power dispatch to them accordingly.  The crucial insight here is that some power consumption, such as running the dishwasher
or charging an electric vehicle, is flexible as long as it is completed by a certain time.  Other power consumption, such as
running the AC in the summer is not flexible.  In total though, this will give the utility more flexibility in dispatching power,
and will smooth demand.

Offsetting the demand smoothing from increased consumer flexibility will be increased variation in power supply.  More and
more power will come from distributed and unpredictable sources: renewables such as wind and solar.  These power supplies
may flucuate during the day, and the level of power available from them at any given point is not knowable in advance.

This creates a coordination and scheduling problem for the utility.  The utilities goal is to use all available power at any
given time, constrained by the need to meet consumer's demands.  If the utility faces a short fall, it has to turn to more 
expensive standby power sources to make up the difference.  Any power that the utility cannot dispatch is wasted.

This scheduling problem is not the only difficulty facing the utility though.  Information about consumer power demands and 
constraints as well as the amount of power being produced flows over a communications network, and it is tautological that 
any communications network can and will be attacked.  We propose a malicious strategic adversary with strong abilities, whose
goal is to destabilize the grid while remaining undetected. 

TODO: Finish overview of our paper and results.  Add citations.  This introduction may well serve as the related works 
section if need be.

\section{Model}

\subsection{Producer}

We focus on renewable energy sources, which provide a fluctuating amount of power.  We model them as exponential random 
number generators [justification?, other possiblities: uniform, power-law].

\subsection{Consumer}

Following [citation here] we have three classes of consumer: buckets, batteries, and bakeries.  

\subsection{Utility}

The utility's goal is to dispatch all power generated in a given time period.  Excess power is wasted, and shortfalls are 
made up from expensive standby generators.  

\subsection{Topology}

Power-law topology for consumers / producers.  We may want to dodge this.

\section{Game}

Our game is played between a strategic adversary that seeks to maximally disrupt the grid, within the constraints of his
resources and the utility company whose objective was given in [utility subsection].  

\subsection{Adversary}

We consider three different capability sets for the adversary:

\begin{itemize}
\item The attacker can jam communication between the utility and producers / consumers.  We consider scenarios where the
attacker can jam 10\%, 30\%, 60\%, and 90\% of communication links with producers / consumers.
\item Attacker can modify the communicated demand from consumers / supply from producers.  Here the attacker is constrained
to a small change in order to remain undetected. This is a false data injection attack.
\item  Attacker can change the consumer's time constraints (effectively change their class).
\end{itemize}

The attackers optimization function is the inverse of the utilities: trying to maximize instead of minimize.

\subsection{Utility}

Utility defaults to base state for each consumer if communication fails.  Conceptually, this is their demand at the same 
point the prior day.

Utility seeks to minimize power wastage / excess demand.

Utility can schedule the known demand of consumers in order to minimize this wastage.  What scheduling strategies
should the utility use, is this something we want to get into?

What is the Utilities defensive strategy: detect? If detect, can it do better than fall back to default?
