On False Data Injection Attacks against Distributed
Energy Routing in Smart Grid

Looks at attacks against distributed energy routing using false data injection.
They assume a static topology, know to each node.
Suply nodes, demand nodes, communication links, and energy links.
Try to satisfy everyone while minimizing cost of transmission.
Increase demand, decrease supply, and futz with topology as attacks.
Analyze effects formally and through simulation.  Show increased costs and potential outages.

 NCS Security Experimentation using DETER


Integrate Networked Control Systems (NCS) and SCADA into their DETER framework
for network experimentation.
DETER's low level modeling and accuracy makes this possible, and realisitic
analysis of DDoS attacks on the smart grid w/ a high level of fidelity
possible.

Modeling Load Redistribution Attacks in
Power Systems

Load redistribution attacks as a special case of false data injection with
immediate and delayed effects.  Lots of linear algebra.  Show how false data
injection can be invisible to current state estimation systems.

Their effective protection strategy amounts to noting that the goal is to 
make the attack detectable, and determining how many nodes they need to do 
so for a given state algorithm.  They don't actually concretely solve this 
problem, merely outline it.

A Taxonomy for Modeling Flexibility and a Computationally Efficient
Algorithm for Dispatch in Smart Grids

Buckets, batteries, and bakeries oh my!

Define each class, note that the goal is to dispatch all generated 
power at a given time step.

Their agile balancing algorithm works best according to their simulations.
Note: not really sure how they are coming up with PDispatch, they don't 
seem to say in the paper.
